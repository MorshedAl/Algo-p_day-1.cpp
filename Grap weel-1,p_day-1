How many edges does a tree with n nodes have?
How many edges does a complete graph with n nodes have?

Convert the following Adjacency Matrix into an Adjacency List and draw the graph. 
(no need to code)

1 0 0 1
1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1
0 0 1 1


Convert the following Adjacency List into an Adjacency Matrix and draw the graph.
(no need to code)

	A -> B, C
B -> B, A, D
C -> D, A
D -> A


Convert the following edge list of an undirected graph to its respective Adjacency List representation.

[
    [A, B, 1]
  [B, C, 3]
  [C, A, 2]
  [E, F, 9]
  [C, D, 1]
  [E, F, 7]
]


Mention the properties of this graph


Is the graph weighted or unweighted?
Does the graph have cycles?
If the graph has cycles, remove some edges to make it acyclic (i.e. with no cycle)
Has the graph become a tree? Why or why not?
If not, then add edges to make it a tree.







1)
How many edges does a tree with n nodes have?

A tree with n vertices , edges= n âˆ’ 1

Example:
if n=1000
 e=1000-1
   =999 (edges)


2)
edges of a complete graph :

n=1, e=0
n=2, e=1
n=3, e=3
n=4, e=6
n=5, e=10
n=6, e=15
edges:
  0+1+3+6+10+15+....
=n*(n-1)/2

3) done!
4) done!

5)

weighted
Yes
Removed A-C edge
Not tree, because 
         1.tree have no cycle,
         2.only one unique path.
